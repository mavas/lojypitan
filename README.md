# lojypitan
Write Lojban instead of Python.

Python Compatability
- Probably start with Python3
- Make it as seemless as possible (CPython, extending/embedding, Cython, etc.)

Lojban Specifics
- Mostly Python, and _then_ Lojban.  We're not trying to reanact the _semantics_ of Lojban in Python; rather, we're trying to write Python, just as usual, but practice Lojban while doing so, if possible/reasonable.

Functionality
- One major and initial influence for lojypitan is lolpython.  It works by _converting_ LOLCODE into Python.  I don't think this is scalable, and/or largely compatible with current and future projects, which is a desirable goal.  This _is_, an approach, though.
